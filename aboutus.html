        <h2>When we first started programming, we found it difficult to grasp the things our teachers taught us, due to the monotonous way that programming was taught. 
            We imagined that there would be a better, a more insightful way of teaching computer science making all students really grasp the beauty behind it. 
            We, Shivank Singh, Hruday Nara, and Ray Pi, decided to combine our skills of programming and started to brainstorm a more innovative way 
            to teach one of the most popular programming language in the world, Python. We made it a necessity to always have our students thoroughly comprehend each and everything we teach, and 
            rather than learning in the montonous way that we were taught, learn in a more hands-on and insightful way. We chose to adopt the 1:2 ratio or in other words for each minute we teach, 
            we have the students work hands on with educational projects for 2 minutes. This means for each of our 45 minute classes where we will be teaching, students can expect to work on their 
            projects for roughly 90 minutes, as homework or during classwork. This means that students would actually learn how to project their skills with real world projects that they themselves create,
        rather than having to listen to a boring hour long lecture. </h2>
